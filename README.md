# zig-workbench
Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. The language is designed for "robustness, optimality and maintainability", supporting compile-time generics and reflection, cross-compilation and manual memory management. A major goal of the language is to compete with (and improve upon) C, while also taking inspiration from Rust, among others.
